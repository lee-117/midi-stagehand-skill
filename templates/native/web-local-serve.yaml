# Template: Local Serve — test local build output with built-in static server
# Use case: Test a locally built SPA or static site without starting a dev server
# serve: path to the directory containing built files (e.g., ./dist, ./build)
# The URL field can use relative paths; Midscene starts a local server automatically
